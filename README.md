# Knative

## Make your developers more productive
Knative components build on top of Kubernetes, abstracting away the complex details and enabling developers to focus on what matters. Built by codifying the best practices shared by successful real-world implementations, Knative solves the "boring but difficult" parts of building, deploying, and managing cloud native services so you don't have to.

## Highlights
* Focused API with higher level abstractions for common app use-cases.
* Stand up a scalable, secure, stateless service in seconds.
* Loosely coupled features let you use the pieces you need.
* Pluggable components let you bring your own logging and monitoring, networking, and service mesh.
* Knative is portable: run it anywhere Kubernetes runs, never worry about vendor lock-in.
* Idiomatic developer experience, supporting common patterns such as GitOps, DockerOps, ManualOps. Knative can be used with common tools and frameworks such as Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring, and may more.
